# A-VOICE-BASED-ELECTRONIC-MAIL-ACCESS-FOR-DISABLED-PERSONS-USING-AI-TECHNIQUES
The project is a python-based application for visually impaired persons using speech to text voice response.
This voice based email system has great application as it is used by blind people as they can understand where they are.
 This is because in order to access the internet one would need to know what is written on the screen. If that is not visible it is of no use to access the email.
 Thus this system enabling everyone to control their mail accounts using their voice only and to be able to read, send, and perform all the other useful tasks. 
The main benefit of this system is that the use of keyboard is completely eliminated, the user will have to respond through voice only.
